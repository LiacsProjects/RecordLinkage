# RecordLinkage #
Bachelor project at Erfgoed Leiden en Omstreken to create historical individuals by linking them with all kinds of historical records.

# Title: #
A novel technique for historical record linkage to unique historical individuals.

# Description: #
Erfgoed Leiden en Omstreken ELO has a database with more than 7 million records related to historical individuals. These records contain their children, persons they got married with, the witnesses of their marriage, or relatives who have died, to mention a few. These data items are all stored in the ELO database.

We aim to create links to these records that “make” the historical persons: or in other words, we want to connect all entries of the identical, unique man or woman. This makes it easier for our website visitors to better find their way through the data. For example, on a birth certificate on our website, we can indicate where a marriage certificate from the child in question can be found. This is necessary to construct family trees or other genealogical research output. 

The construction of these links will also facilitate new research questions on a larger population scale such as: did people get married or die in the same town they were born in? Where did the person’s professions change throughout their lives? Did the age of death of your parents influence your own life expectancy? And many more questions which will definitely pop up during browsing through the linked records.

It is currently not possible to conduct research on a such large population scale. Even small-scale research - for instance to find all records about your ancestor - is not that easy. You need to investigate whether the Jan Janssen in one record is the same as the Jan Janssen in another by comparing various criteria, such as the date of birth or the profession. And the name variations are also challenging to map to one unique historical individual. Someone can be registered as Nella, and the next time she could be listed as Petronella. One challenge is also that terms for professions (baker/backer) and places (Leiden/Leyden) are not always unique. And finally, errors are sometimes made in the original historical registration or while entering the data in our database. 

The challenges mentioned above ask for a solution to connect historical data to unique historical individuals with advanced data-science algorithms. Some preliminary work has been done already. Good examples are the LINK, Stanford (ABE), and Lenticular Lenses (see our references list below), but there are many more methods available.

# Research questions: #
- Is it possible to link selected available data at ELO by means of automation to unique historical individuals to come to an appurtenant family tree?
- What will be the state-of-the-art methods that can achieve the above question?
- Which parameters will give the best results and what should be adjusted to our data in order to make better links?

# Planning: #
During this research, you will
- assess which methods are most suitable for linking the records of historical persons.
- apply one or more methods to the data of Erfgoed Leiden. 
- assess how the methods - that you adopted from the scientific literature - can be improved, and apply these novelties. 
- Visualize the connections found to have it evaluated by historians.
- In particular visualize the appurtenant family tree.
